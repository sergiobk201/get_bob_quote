# üìà Boliviano Parallel Exchange Rate Fetch

This project provides a simple **exchange rate tool** using the [Binance P2P API](https://p2p.binance.com).  
It fetches the latest **BOB/USDT exchange rate**, as well as maintain a historic csv for further analysis or plotting.

Bolivia has fallen into a deep economic struggle with low international reserves and an unstable political environment. This caused a devaluation of the currency.
The exchange rate has been fixed for the last 20 years at around 6.96 BOB per USD. This caused an imbalance on the markets as the balance of payments were not generating enough reserves to maintain the rate. In addition to this, Bolivia has a subsidy for gasoline to maintain low prices.

This led to an economic crisis where the scarcity of dollars became unsustainable. People don't have the ability to buy and sell dollars freely anymore, and there is also a scarcity of gasoline and diesel. The government maintained the fixed exchange rate model and a parallel market was born. People can buy and sell USD at higher prices via P2P platforms like Binance P2P or in person with different forex houses.  

As a boliviano myself, after being constantly asked about the evolution of the parallel rate and the latest price of the dollar, I created this small project for anyone that is curious to know the latest quote as well as have an idea of how it's behaving through time. 

I hope you find this project as interesting as it is for me.
